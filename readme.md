# JDBot
## A Discord bot that connects to a REST api for user data storage
### Commands:
* _ping
* _leaderboard
* _rest
* _conch

### Instructions:
Run with Discord Bot Token as argument  
Or compile to jar and run with:
"java -jar JDBot.jar <Bot_Token>"

(Although message history could probably be obtained from the Channel class' method getHistory, I wanted an excuse to 
create a REST api)
